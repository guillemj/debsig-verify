- Make sure all error checking is done
- Create some test setups to verify the policy parsing
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
  * Yes, there is PGG, but it is merely a wrapper around the GPG binary. A
    very good wrapper, but it is hugely overweight for what I need.
    Basically this may be a dead issue. Otherwise, I should probably start
    using the --with-colon and --status-fd output for better parsing.
- Add another option to force only trying a specific policy. We cannot
  change the originID, so we force which policy to use under a specific
  originID.
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
- Free memory from policy struct (minor mem leak).
- Expiry still needs to be handled
