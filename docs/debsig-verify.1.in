.SH NAME
debsig\-verify \- Verify signatures for a Debian format package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 6
\fBdebsig\-verify\fR [\fBoptions\fR] <\fBdeb\fR>
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is part of a security model that verifies the source and
validity of a Debian format package (commonly refered to as a \fBdeb\fR).
.PP
This program implements the verification specs defined in the document,
"\fBPackage Verification with dpkg: Implementation\fR",
which is a more complete reference for the verification procedure.
.PP
The program generally takes one argument, the \fBdeb\fR file to be
verified. It will then check the \fBorigin\fR signature of the \fBdeb\fR,
find its Public Key ID (long format), and use that as the name for a policy
subdirectory. If this subdirectory does not exist, then the verification
fails immediately.
.PP
In this subdirectory, the program finds one or more files named with
the \fB.pol\fR file extension, which signifies an XML format policy
definition. This file contains three main parts.
.PP
.TP
.BR Origin
Information about the origin of this policy.
.TP
.BR Selection
Rules used to decide if this policy is pertinent to this \fBdeb\fR's
verification.
.TP
.BR Verification
Rules that are used to actually verify the \fBdeb\fR.
.PP
The policy files will reference keyrings by a filename. These keyrings
will be looked for in a subdirectory of the keyring directory. The
subdirectory has the same name as the policy subdirectory (previously
determined by the Origin's Public Key ID).
.PP
The program will, after first parsing the entire file, check the Origin
ID against the Public Key ID of the \fBorigin\fR signature in the \fBdeb\fR.
If these match (which they should, else something is really wrong), then
it will proceed to the \fBSelection\fR rules.
.PP
The \fBSelection\fR rules decide whether this policy is suitable for
verifying this \fBdeb\fR. If these rules fail, then the program will proceed
to the next policy. If it passes, then the program commits to using this
policy for verification, and no other policies will be referenced.
.PP
The last verification step relies on the \fBVerification\fR rules. These
are similar in format to the \fBSelection\fR rules, but are usually more
constrained. If these rules fail, the program exits with a non-zero
status. If they pass, then it exits with a zero status.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-q
Causes the program to send no output, other than fatal errors. This is
useful when being called from another program, where you rely on the exit
value only.
.TP
.BR \-v
Causes the program to send more output on execution, so as to follow the
steps it is taking while trying to verify the \fBdeb\fR.
.TP
.BR \-d
Outputs even more info than the \fB\-v\fR option. This is mainly for
debugging.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Outputs the version information for the program. This includes the policy
format version. This option does not require any other arguments.
.TP
.BR \-\-list\-policies
Outputs a list of the policies that passed the \fBSelection\fR phase of
the verification process. In other words, those that could potentially
verify the \fBdeb\fR. The output is one line showing the directory selected
by the \fBorigin\fR signature, and then a single line for any policy files
in that directory that pass the \fBSelection\fR rules. This option will \fBNOT\fR
verify the \fBdeb\fR.
.TP
.BR \-\-use\-policy\ <pol>
This option takes one argument, which is the name of the
policy file (as shown by the \fB\-\-list\-policies\fR option). Note, this is
just a file, and not a full path. You cannot specifiy arbitrary policies.
This option is useful if more than one policy applies to potentially
verifying the \fBdeb\fR. The program will then use this policy, and only
this policy, to try and verify the \fBdeb\fR.
