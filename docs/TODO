- Make sure all error checking is done
- Create some test setups to verify the policy parsing
- One small ar usage left.
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
- Add an option so that we just lists policies that can validate this deb
- Add --verbose and --quiet options
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
- Convert to using expat, which is smaller, but uses a different interface
  (it also actually works when we compile with -static).
- Free memory from policy struct (minor mem leak).
- Add the DayExpiry type to the DTD and code parsing
