- Make sure all error checking is done
- Create some test setups to verify the policy parsing
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
- Add an option so that we just list policies that can validate this deb
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
- Free memory from policy struct (minor mem leak).
- Expiry still needs to be handled
