- Make sure all error checking is done
- Create some test setups to verify the policy parsing
- Implement an internal ar archive parser to do away with the binutils dep
  * all we need is one function of this type:
  
    size_t findMember(FILE *fp, const char *name);
    
    This will take an open file stream pointer, position it to the start
    of the member, and return the length of that member. If it returns 0,
    then the member does not exist. If it returns a -1, then this is not
    an "ar" archive. "name" is the name of the member we are searching
    for.
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
- Add an option so that we just lists policies that can validate this deb
- Add --verbose and --quiet options
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
- Convert to using expat, which is smaller, but uses a different interface
  (it also actually works when we compile with -static).
