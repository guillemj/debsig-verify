- Make sure all error checking is done
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
  * Yes, there is PGG, but it is merely a wrapper around the GPG binary. A
    very good wrapper, but it is hugely overweight for what I need.
    Basically this may be a dead issue. Otherwise, I should probably start
    using the --with-colon and --status-fd output for better parsing.
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
- Expiry still needs to be handled
- Add some more info to the verbose output.

- Testing setup. This is the way I invision it. Basically we have
  directories with sample data. Each directory contains some related parts
  of a Debian file (control.tar.gz, data.tar.gz), signatures and
  policy's/keyrings. We than have some XML files (god I love XML :) that
  describe the tests. This includes which parts to use to build the debs,
  and which policies. Need a program that parses this and performs the
  jobs. One drawback is, how can we tell debsig-verify where to find the
  polices and keyrings, since it is hardcoded? Should we allow command
  line options to override this?
