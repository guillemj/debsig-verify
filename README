Building from git source
------------------------

To prepare the debsig-verify source tree from git before starting the build
process some required software needs to be installed:

  GNU autoconf >= 2.60
  GNU automake >= 1.11

After installing the needed software, and running the following command on
the git tree:

  $ ./autogen

the source should be roughly equivalent to the distributed tar source.


Building from source
--------------------

The minimum software required to configure and build debsig-verify from a
tarball is:

  C89 compiler
  GNU make
  pkg-config
  libdpkg-dev
  libexpat1-dev

The build process is done by running the usual «./configure; make check».
To see all available configuration options please run «./configure --help».
