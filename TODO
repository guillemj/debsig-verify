- Make sure all error checking is done
- Create some test setups to verify the policy parsing
- Implement an internal ar archive parser to do away with the binutils dep
- Is there a GnuPG library we can link against instead of execing gpg?
- Add an option so that we just lists policies that can validate this deb
- Add --verbose and --quiet options
- Figure out how to integrate this with the package tools (apt, dpkg
  etc..)
